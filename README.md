# codebits
Small bits of code I've written over the years. Some are useful little scripts made to solve everyday problems encountered while coding (image conversion, text file manipulation, etc.) and others are solutions to common coding challenges.

## python-codebits
Python scripts to do various coding tasks such as batch converting images, formatting text in desired ways.

## algorithms
From-scratch implementations of well-known algorithms, mostly in Python.

## data-structures
From-scratch implementations of well-known data structures, mostly in Python.

## challenges
Java / Python / JS solutions to common coding challenges.
